# Barrel Street

Barrel Street is a modern, premium bar website built to showcase a curated drinks menu with a clean, high-end UI experience.  
The project focuses on **responsive design, layout consistency, and real-world UI structure**, similar to what is expected in production restaurant or lounge websites.

This project was built as part of a hands-on learning journey into **frontend architecture, custom CSS responsiveness, and scalable UI design**.

## Responsive Design Approach

Barrel Street is built with a **custom, CSS-first responsive design** UI.

The layout is optimized for a wide range of devices using carefully planned media queries and flexible layouts.

### Key highlights:
- Desktop-first design, progressively adapted for smaller screens
- Media queries targeting common breakpoints:
  - Mobile (≤ 480px)
  - Large phones (≤ 640px)
  - Tablets (≤ 768px)
  - Small laptops (≤ 1024px)
- Responsive layouts built using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Images scale smoothly without causing layout shifts
- Navigation, menu sections, forms, and footers adapt cleanly across devices
- Special attention given to **readability, spacing, and touch-friendly UI** on mobile

All pages were tested using Chrome DevTools to ensure there are **no layout breaks, overflows, or usability issues** across common screen sizes.
